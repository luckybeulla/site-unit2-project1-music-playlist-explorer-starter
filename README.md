### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Lab 3 of Unit 2 helped to implemeny the like functionality and populate playlist cards with data from the JSON file.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
Attempted the sorting options stretch feature
Fetching details of the playlists the user adds from the internet rather than have them manually type these details.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Ensuring that my undeployed website server stays live as I get ready to present so it does not crush while I am demonstrating the website features.
